Iris Flower Classification
This project uses various machine learning algorithms to classify iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The dataset used is the famous Iris dataset, which consists of 150 samples with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a model that can accurately classify iris flowers based on their features. Several machine learning algorithms are evaluated, and the best-performing model is selected for making predictions.

Steps
Load the dataset: The Iris dataset is loaded from a URL.
Data preparation: The dataset is split into training and validation sets.
Model evaluation: Six different algorithms are evaluated using cross-validation.
Algorithm comparison: The performance of each algorithm is compared using a box plot.
Model training and prediction: The best-performing model (SVM) is trained on the training set and used to make predictions on the validation set.
Evaluation: The accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report of the model are printed to evaluate its performance.
